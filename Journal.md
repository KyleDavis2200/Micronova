Today I started the CAD for the robot. The plan going in was to maximize the size of the weapon while keeping everything as simple as possible. To accomplish this, I planned to use 3/8" UHMW frame rails, tangent drive, and an aluminum eggbeater driven by a custom hubmotor. The custom hubmotor eggbeater is the main focus of this project, as the rest of the robot is very generic and similar to many other four wheel drive eggbeaters.

To start, I laid out a master sketch from the top down view that contained where all of the main components would be located.

I also created a second master sketch from the side view. This sketch references dimensions in the first view and helps provide the basis for other parts in the robot that contain most of their features in this plane.

The first part I modeled was the uprights. These are the main structure of the robot as they keep the drive belts in tension, the rear wheel and the tangent drive shaft in compression, and keep the weapon rigidly attached. The uprights feature a pocket for the drive motor to sit in and for its wires to come out of and a pocket for the weapon shaft insert to sit in to prevent the holes in the UHMW uprights from ovalling out on big impacts. The uprights also feature holes for mounting the drive shafts, weapon motor, drive motors, fork standoffs, and the TPU front and back plates. The top and bottom of the uprights have holes for mounting the top and bottom plates with #4 plastite screws. The uprights feature partial pockets throuhgout the empty space of the part to reduce weight. The top front corner of the part has mounting for an "ear" that prevents the weapon from hitting the ground when upside down.

The left upright is a mirror image of the right upright that was shown first, except it includes through pockets for passing the weapon motor wires through into the frame.

The next part I designed was the top plate, which has mounting holes into the uprights and a standoff in the TPU front plate and TPU back plate. This ties the uprights together and is the main structure between the sides of the robot besides the weapon shaft.

The first issue in my desing process occured when I realized that the aluminum inserts that prevent the holes for the weapon shaft in the frame rails from ovalling out would stick out past the frame rail on the other side. This is a simple remedy if you have access to a mill or lathe. All you need to do is face 0.094" off of the round side.

To prepare the motor for the hubmotor setup the shaft and bearings are removed, and the center of the motor is drilled out to 10mm. The spinning end of the can is removed from the magnet ring to save space along the shaft. The magnet ring will be retained by a press fit into the weapon.

At this point I had most of the main frame laid out, and could insert most of the hardware and drive system. I used Lego wheels and repeat tangent motors for this robot as it provides a compact, cheap, fast, and easy drive solution . After inserting all of the components that attached to the frame, began to work on the weapon design.

This weapon design ties into the initial master sketches, which is where it gets its 4.25" effective diameter from. This weapon has an asymmetric design, increasing bite and optimizing energy transfer.

After cutting a rectangle through the middle of the part and filleting the corners, the initial design is mostly done.


<img width="966" height="999" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2530e1a9-afb2-4f78-9366-3939473af375" />

I got the weapon design to this point, with a pocket for the motor and a guard around the outside of the motor when I realized a large problem with this design. There was not a good spot tot put a bearing on the motor side of the shaft that would provide sufficient support in combat. This led me to abandon this design and try a different style of hubmotor eggbeater where the whole side by the weapon motor is thicker so that a bearing can be put right next to the motor.

The revised weapon came out mostly similar to the initial one, except I made it a bit thinner along its thickness and thickened up the weapon motor side severely. This will also keep the weapon motor very safe in combat.

The next part I designed was the front plate, which, for the most part, is a simple 1/8" thick rectangle of TPU that fills in the space between the bottom plate, uprights, and top plate in the front of the robot. It features a pocket for a hex standoff to sit in and it has geometry on the sides that corresponds to the pockets in the uprights, with a hole on either side for it to be mounted with a plastite screw.

The back plate features a similar design philosophy as the front plate, but it is much thicker as it can be directly hit by opponents. It also has two mounting holes on either side and a pocket for the head of the drive shaft screw to sit in.

I started today by designing thet wheelguard. The wheelguard is a simple TPU rectangle that down the side of the robot to protect the wheels and drive belts. It mounts onto two hex standoffs in the middle and two round standoffs in the front where the forks are mounted. The TPU comes in at the front and covers the standguards to improve strength and prevent the standoffs from getting hit directly.

The next part that I designed is the ear. The ear starts as a triangle with a rounded top, and then has its mounted geometry added along with some filets and chamfers to make it look better. To mount the ears I am using three plastite screws per ear that will thread into the outside of the ear, the upright, and then the other side of the ear. This allows me to make the wheels as rigidly mounted as possible. The TPU surrounding each side of the upright futher contributes to the rigidity.

The next step was to design the forks. Forks get under the opponents robot, making it harder for them to drive and giving your weapon a better angle to catch onto their robot. These forks are made out of 1/4" AR500 because the hardness helps deflect weapons and the strength prevents them from bending. The forks have a round hole on the bottom to pivot around, and a slot on the top to allow them to rotate while also being constrained in the angles that they can rotate to.

After heavily pocketing the forks to save weight, the forks, and the rest of the robot, are done.
